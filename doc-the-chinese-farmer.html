<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote cite="Alan Watts">
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>The farmer said, <q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> <br>
    The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br>
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that's too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br>
    The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn't that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br>
    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad - because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

<h2>Here is this dialog in the form of a table</h2>
    <table><caption>Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</caption>
        <tr>
            <th>Event</th>
            <th class="bad good">Good or bad ?</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Lose a horse</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Win more horses</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Son injury</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Avoid war</td>
            <td>Maybe</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. <br>
        Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
